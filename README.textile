h2. Simulates a simple interactive Graphical Editor

Graphical editors allow users to edit images in the same way text editors let us modify documents.
Images are represented as an M x N array of pixels with each pixel given colour.

h3. Input

The input consists of a line containing a sequence of commands. Each command is represented by a single capital letter
at the start of the line. Arguments to the command are separated by spaces and follow the command character.

Pixel co-ordinates are represented by a pair of integers: 1) a column number between 1 and M, and 2) a row number
between 1 and N. Where 1 <= M, N <= 250. The origin sits in the upper-left of the table.Colours are specified by capital letters.

h3. Commands

The editor supports 7 commands:

# *I M N* - Create a new M x N image with all pixels coloured white (O).
# *C* - Clears the table, setting all pixels to white (O).
# *L X Y C* - Colours the pixel (X,Y) with colour C.
# *V X Y1 Y2 C* - Draw a vertical segment of colour C in column X between rows Y1 and Y2 (inclusive).
# *H X1 X2 Y C* - Draw a horizontal segment of colour C in row Y between columns X1 and X2 (inclusive).
# *F X Y C* - Fill the region R with the colour C. R is defined as: Pixel (X,Y) belongs to R. Any other pixel which is the same colour as (X,Y) and shares a common side with any pixel in R also belongs to this region.
# *S* - Show the contents of the current image
# *X* - Terminate the session
